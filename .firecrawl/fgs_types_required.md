To help developers be more intentional with defining user-facing [foreground\\
services](https://developer.android.com/guide/components/foreground-services), Android 10 introduced the `android:foregroundServiceType`
attribute within the [`<service>`](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/service-element) element.

If your app targets Android 14, it must specify appropriate foreground service
types. As in previous versions of Android, multiple types can be combined. This
list shows the foreground service types to choose from:

- [`camera`](https://developer.android.com/about/versions/14/changes/fgs-types-required#camera)
- [`connectedDevice`](https://developer.android.com/about/versions/14/changes/fgs-types-required#connected-device)
- [`dataSync`](https://developer.android.com/about/versions/14/changes/fgs-types-required#data-sync)
- [`health`](https://developer.android.com/about/versions/14/changes/fgs-types-required#health)
- [`location`](https://developer.android.com/about/versions/14/changes/fgs-types-required#location)
- [`mediaPlayback`](https://developer.android.com/about/versions/14/changes/fgs-types-required#media)
- [`mediaProjection`](https://developer.android.com/about/versions/14/changes/fgs-types-required#media-projection)
- [`microphone`](https://developer.android.com/about/versions/14/changes/fgs-types-required#microphone)
- [`phoneCall`](https://developer.android.com/about/versions/14/changes/fgs-types-required#phone-call)
- [`remoteMessaging`](https://developer.android.com/about/versions/14/changes/fgs-types-required#remote-messaging)
- [`shortService`](https://developer.android.com/about/versions/14/changes/fgs-types-required#short-service)
- [`specialUse`](https://developer.android.com/about/versions/14/changes/fgs-types-required#special-use)
- [`systemExempted`](https://developer.android.com/about/versions/14/changes/fgs-types-required#system-exempted)

If a use case in your app isn't associated with any of these types, we strongly
recommend that you migrate your logic to use [WorkManager](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/workmanager) or
[user-initiated data transfer jobs](https://developer.android.com/develop/background-work/background-tasks/uidt).

The `health, remoteMessaging, shortService, specialUse`, and `systemExempted`
types are new in Android 14.

The following code snippet provides an example of a foreground service type
declaration in the manifest:

```
<manifest ...>
  <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.FOREGROUND_SERVICE" />
  <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.FOREGROUND_SERVICE_MEDIA_PLAYBACK" />
    <application ...>
      <service
          android:name=".MyMediaPlaybackService"
          android:foregroundServiceType="mediaPlayback"
          android:exported="false">
      </service>
    </application>
</manifest>
```

If an app that targets Android 14 doesn't define types for a given service in
the manifest, then the system will raise `MissingForegroundServiceTypeException`
upon calling [`startForeground()`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/Service#startForeground(int,%20android.app.Notification)) for that service.

## Declare new permission to use foreground service types

If apps that target Android 14 use a foreground service, they must declare a
specific permission, based on the foreground service type, that Android 14
introduces. These permissions appear in the sections labeled "permission that
you must declare in your manifest file" in the [intended use cases and\\
enforcement for each foreground service type](https://developer.android.com/about/versions/14/changes/fgs-types-required#use-cases) section on this page.

All of the permissions are defined as [normal permissions](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/permissions/overview#install-time) and are
granted by default. Users cannot revoke these permissions.

### Include foreground service type at runtime

The best practice for applications starting foreground services is to use the
`ServiceCompat` version of [`startForeground()`](https://developer.android.com/reference/androidx/core/app/ServiceCompat#startForeground(android.app.Service,int,android.app.Notification,int)) (available in androidx-core
1.12 and higher) where you pass in a bitwise
integer of foreground service types. You can choose to pass one or more type
values.

Usually, you should declare only the types required for a particular use case.
This makes it easier to meet the [system's expectations for each foreground\\
service type](https://developer.android.com/guide/components/foreground-services#fgs-prerequisites).
In cases where a foreground service is started with multiple types,
then the foreground service must adhere to the [platform enforcement\\
requirements](https://developer.android.com/guide/components/foreground-services#runtime-permissions)
of **all** types.

```
ServiceCompat.startForeground(0, notification, FOREGROUND_SERVICE_TYPE_LOCATION)
```

If the foreground service type is not specified in the call, the type defaults
to the values defined in the manifest. If you didn't specify the service
type in the manifest, the system throws
[`MissingForegroundServiceTypeException`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/MissingForegroundServiceTypeException).

If the foreground service needs new permissions after you launch it, you
should call `startForeground()` again and add the new service types. For
example, suppose a fitness app runs a running-tracker service that always needs
`location` information, but might or might not need `media` permissions. You
would need to declare both `location` and `mediaPlayback` in the manifest. If a
user starts a run and just wants their location tracked, your app should call
`startForeground()` and pass just the `location` service type. Then, if the user
wants to start playing audio, call `startForeground()` again and pass
`location|mediaPlayback`.

## System runtime checks

The system checks for proper use of foreground service types and confirms that
the app has requested the proper runtime permissions or uses the required APIs.
For instance, the system expects apps that use the foreground service type
[`FOREGROUND_SERVICE_TYPE_LOCATION`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/content/pm/ServiceInfo#FOREGROUND_SERVICE_TYPE_LOCATION) type to request either
`ACCESS_COARSE_LOCATION` or `ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION`.

This implies that apps must follow a very specific
order of operations when requesting permissions from the user and starting
foreground services. Permissions must be requested and granted _before_ the
app attempts to call `startForeground()`. Apps that request the appropriate
permissions after the foreground service has been started must change this order
of operations and request the permission before starting the foreground service.

The specifics of platform enforcement appear in the sections labeled
"runtime requirements" in the [intended use cases and enforcement for each\\
foreground service type](https://developer.android.com/about/versions/14/changes/fgs-types-required#use-cases) section on this page.

## Intended use cases and enforcement for each foreground service type

In order to use a given foreground service type, you must declare a particular
permission in your manifest file, you must fulfill specific runtime
requirements, and your app must fulfill one of the intended sets of use cases
for that type. The following sections explain the permission that you must
declare, the runtime prerequisites, and the intended use cases for each type.

### Camera

Foreground service type to declare in manifest under `android:foregroundServiceType``camera`Permission to declare in your manifest[`FOREGROUND_SERVICE_CAMERA`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/Manifest.permission#FOREGROUND_SERVICE_CAMERA)Constant to pass to `startForeground()`[`FOREGROUND_SERVICE_TYPE_CAMERA`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/content/pm/ServiceInfo#FOREGROUND_SERVICE_TYPE_CAMERA)Runtime prerequisites

Request and be granted the [`CAMERA`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/Manifest.permission#CAMERA) runtime permission

**Note:** The `CAMERA` runtime permission is subject to while-in-use
restrictions. For this reason, you cannot create a `camera` foreground
service while your app is in the background, [with a few\\
exceptions](https://developer.android.com/develop/background-work/services/fgs/restrictions-bg-start#wiu-restrictions-exemptions).
For more information, see
[Restrictions on starting foreground services that need while-in-use\\
permissions](https://developer.android.com/develop/background-work/services/fgs/restrictions-bg-start#wiu-restrictions).

Description

Continue to access the camera from the background, such as video chat apps
that allow for multitasking.

  - [`ACTIVITY_RECOGNITION`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/Manifest.permission#ACTIVITY_RECOGNITION)

**Note:** The `BODY_SENSORS` and sensor-based READ runtime permissions are
subject to while-in-use restrictions. For this reason, you cannot create a
`health` foreground service that uses body sensors while your app is in the
background unless you've been granted the [`BODY_SENSORS_BACKGROUND`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/Manifest.permission#BODY_SENSORS_BACKGROUND)
(API level 33 to 35) or
[`READ_HEALTH_DATA_IN_BACKGROUND`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/health/connect/HealthPermissions#READ_HEALTH_DATA_IN_BACKGROUND) (API level 36 and higher) permissions.
For more information, see [Restrictions on starting foreground services that\\
need while-in-use permissions](https://developer.android.com/develop/background-work/services/fgs/restrictions-bg-start#wiu-restrictions).

The user must have enabled location services and the app must be granted
at least one of the following runtime permissions:

- [`ACCESS_COARSE_LOCATION`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/Manifest.permission#ACCESS_COARSE_LOCATION)
- [`ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/Manifest.permission#ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION)

**Note:** In order to check that the user has enabled location services
as well as granted access to the runtime permissions, use
[`PermissionChecker#checkSelfPermission()`](https://developer.android.com/reference/androidx/core/content/PermissionChecker#checkSelfPermission(android.content.Context,java.lang.String))

**Note:** The location runtime permissions are subject to while-in-use
restrictions. For this reason, you cannot create a `location` foreground
service while your app is in the background,
unless you've been granted the [`ACCESS_BACKGROUND_LOCATION`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/Manifest.permission#ACCESS_BACKGROUND_LOCATION) runtime
permission. For more information, see
[Restrictions on starting foreground services that need while-in-use\\
permissions](https://developer.android.com/guide/components/foreground-services#wiu-restrictions).

Description

Quickly finish critical work that cannot be interrupted or postponed.

This type has some unique characteristics:

- Can only run for a short period of time (about 3 minutes).
- No support for [sticky](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/Service#START_STICKY) foreground services.
- Cannot start other foreground services.
- Doesn't require a [type-specific permission](https://developer.android.com/about/versions/14/changes/fgs-types-required#permission-for-fgs-type), though it still
requires the [`FOREGROUND_SERVICE`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/Manifest.permission#FOREGROUND_SERVICE) permission.
- A `shortService` can only change to another service type if the app is
currently eligible to start a new foreground service.
- A foreground service can change its type to `shortService` at any time,
at which point the timeout period begins.

The timeout for shortService begins from the moment that
[`Service.startForeground()`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/Service#startForeground(int,%20android.app.Notification,%20int)) is called. The app is expected to call
[`Service.stopSelf()`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/Service#stopSelf()) or [`Service.stopForeground()`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/Service#stopForeground(int)) before the
timeout occurs. Otherwise, the new `Service.onTimeout()` is called, giving
apps a brief opportunity to call `stopSelf()` or `stopForeground()` to stop
their service.

A short time after `Service.onTimeout()` is called, the app enters a [cached\\
state](https://developer.android.com/guide/components/activities/process-lifecycle) and is no longer considered to be in the foreground, unless the
user is actively interacting with the app. A short time after the app is
cached and the service has not stopped, the app receives an [ANR](https://developer.android.com/topic/performance/vitals/anr). The
ANR message mentions `FOREGROUND_SERVICE_TYPE_SHORT_SERVICE`. For these
reasons, it's considered best practice to implement the
`Service.onTimeout()` callback.

The `Service.onTimeout()` callback doesn't exist on Android 13 and lower. If
the same service runs on such devices, it doesn't receive a timeout, nor
does it ANR. Make sure that your service stops as soon as it finishes the
processing task, even if it hasn't received the `Service.onTimeout()`
callback yet.

It's important to note that if the timeout of the `shortService` is not
respected, the app will ANR even if it has other valid foreground services
or other app lifecycle processes running.

If an app is visible to the user or satisfies one of the [exemptions](https://developer.android.com/guide/components/foreground-services#background-start-restriction-exemptions)
that allow foreground services to be started from the background, calling
`Service.StartForeground()` again with the
`FOREGROUND_SERVICE_TYPE_SHORT_SERVICE` parameter extends the timeout by
another 3 minutes. If the app isn't visible to the user and doesn't
satisfy one of the [exemptions](https://developer.android.com/guide/components/foreground-services#background-start-restriction-exemptions), any attempt to start another
foreground service, regardless of type, causes a
[`ForegroundServiceStartNotAllowedException`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/ForegroundServiceStartNotAllowedException).

If a user disables [battery optimization](https://support.google.com/pixelphone/answer/7015477) for your app, it's
still affected by the timeout of shortService FGS.

If you start a foreground service that includes the `shortService` type and
another foreground service type, the system ignores the `shortService` type
declaration. However, the service must still adhere to the prerequisites of
the other declared types. For more information, see the [Foreground services\\
documentation](https://developer.android.com/guide/components/foreground-services).

### Special use

Foreground service type to declare in manifest under`android:foregroundServiceType``specialUse`Permission to declare in your manifest[`FOREGROUND_SERVICE_SPECIAL_USE`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/Manifest.permission#FOREGROUND_SERVICE_SPECIAL_USE)Constant to pass to `startForeground()`[`FOREGROUND_SERVICE_TYPE_SPECIAL_USE`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/content/pm/ServiceInfo#FOREGROUND_SERVICE_TYPE_SPECIAL_USE)Runtime prerequisitesNoneDescription

Covers any valid foreground service use cases that aren't covered by the other
foreground service types.

In addition to declaring the `FOREGROUND_SERVICE_TYPE_SPECIAL_USE`
foreground service type, developers should declare use cases in the
manifest. To do so, they specify the `<property>` element within the
[`<service>`](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/service-element) element. These values and corresponding use cases are
reviewed when you submit your app in the Google Play Console. The use
cases you provide are free-form, and you should make sure to provide enough
information to let the reviewer see why you need to use the `specialUse`
type.

```
<service android:name="fooService" android:foregroundServiceType="specialUse">
  <property android:name="android.app.PROPERTY_SPECIAL_USE_FGS_SUBTYPE"
      android:value="explanation_for_special_use"/>
</service>
```

### System exempted

Reserved for system applications and specific system integrations, to
continue to use foreground services.

To use this type, an app must meet at least one of the following criteria:

- Device is in demo mode state
- App is a [Device Owner](https://source.android.com/devices/tech/admin/provision)
- App is a [Profiler Owner](https://source.android.com/devices/tech/admin/managed-profiles)
- Safety Apps that have the [`ROLE_EMERGENCY`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/app/role/RoleManager#ROLE_EMERGENCY) role
- [Device Admin](https://developer.android.com/work/device-admin) apps
- Apps holding [`SCHEDULE_EXACT_ALARM`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/Manifest.permission#SCHEDULE_EXACT_ALARM) or
[`USE_EXACT_ALARM`](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/Manifest.permission#USE_EXACT_ALARM) permission and are using
Foreground Service to continue alarms in the background,
including haptics-only alarms.
- VPN apps (configured using **Settings > Network & Internet > VPN**)

Otherwise, declaring this type causes the system to throw a
`ForegroundServiceTypeNotAllowedException`.


## Google Play policy enforcement for using foreground service types

If your app targets Android 14 or higher, you'll need to declare your app's
foreground service types in the Play Console's app content page ( **Policy >**
**App content**). For more information on how to declare your foreground
service types in Play Console, see [Understanding foreground service and\\
full-screen intent requirements](https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/answer/13392821).
