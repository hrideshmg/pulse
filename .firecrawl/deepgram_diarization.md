## Diarization Models

Deepgram offers versioned diarization models. Use the `diarize_model` parameter to select a specific version:

| Value | Batch | Streaming |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `latest` | Resolves to the latest GA batch diarizer (currently v2) | Resolves to the latest GA streaming diarizer (currently v1) |
| `v2` | Pins to the v2 diarizer | Not supported — returns a validation error |
| `v1` | Pins to the v1 diarizer | Pins to the v1 streaming diarizer |

Specifying `diarize_model` both enables diarization **and** selects the model version. You do not need to also set `diarize=true`.

### Choosing a Model

- **New integrations**: Use `diarize_model=latest` to always get the newest available diarizer.
- **Pin a specific version**: Use `diarize_model=v1` or `diarize_model=v2` (batch only).
- **Streaming**: Use `diarize_model=latest` or `diarize_model=v1`. The v2 diarizer is not available for streaming and returns a validation error.

## Enable Feature

### Using `diarize_model` (recommended)

Use the `diarize_model` parameter to enable diarization and select the model version in a single parameter:

cURL

```
curl \
  --request POST \
  --header 'Authorization: Token YOUR_DEEPGRAM_API_KEY' \
  --header 'Content-Type: audio/wav' \
  --data-binary @youraudio.wav \
  --url 'https://api.deepgram.com/v1/listen?diarize_model=latest'
```

### Using `diarize` (deprecated)

The `diarize` parameter is deprecated. Use `diarize_model` instead for both batch and streaming requests.

The boolean `diarize` parameter continues to work and always routes to the v1 diarizer:

`diarize=true`

cURL

```
curl \
  --request POST \
  --header 'Authorization: Token YOUR_DEEPGRAM_API_KEY' \
  --header 'Content-Type: audio/wav' \
  --data-binary @youraudio.wav \
  --url 'https://api.deepgram.com/v1/listen?diarize=true'
```

Replace `YOUR_DEEPGRAM_API_KEY` with your [Deepgram API Key](https://console.deepgram.com/signup?jump=keys).

**Self-hosted deployments:**`diarize=true` is pinned to the v1 batch diarizer. New self-hosted deployments provisioned at the May 2026 release (`release-260514`) or later receive only the v2 batch diarizer model by default — `diarize=true` on those deployments returns a successful response without `speaker` labels, consistent with Deepgram’s longstanding behavior when a requested diarizer model is not present. To produce diarized output on a fresh deployment, specify `diarize_model=v2` or `diarize_model=latest`. See the [Self-Hosted May 2026 release notes](https://developers.deepgram.com/changelog/self-hosted-changelog#deepgram-self-hosted-may-2026-release-260514) for details.

## Versioning Behavior

Switch your `diarize=true` requests to `diarize_model` (use `latest` for most cases). Don’t set both `diarize` and `diarize_model` — requests that set both are rejected.

### Model Compatibility

Diarization is compatible with all Nova batch models (Nova-1, Nova-2, Nova-3) as well as enhanced and base. Whisper is not supported.

### Streaming

`diarize_model` is accepted on streaming requests with the following values:

- `diarize_model=v1` — uses the v1 streaming diarizer.
- `diarize_model=latest` — resolves to the latest streaming diarizer (currently v1).
- `diarize_model=v2` — **not supported** on streaming. Returns a validation error.

The deprecated `diarize=true` parameter also continues to work for streaming and routes to the v1 diarizer.

## Analyze Response

For this example, we use an MP3 audio file that contains the beginning of a customer call with Premier Phone Services. If you would like to follow along, you can [download it](https://res.cloudinary.com/deepgram/video/upload/v1680127025/dg-audio/nasa-spacewalk-interview_ljjahn.wav).

When the file is finished processing, you’ll receive a JSON response. Let’s look more closely at the `words` object within the `alternatives` object within this response.

### Pre-Recorded

When using diarization for pre-recorded audio, both `speaker` and `speaker_confidence` values will be returned:

JSON

```
...
"alternatives":[\
  {\
    ...\
    "words": [\
      {\
        "word":"hello",\
        "start":15.259043,\
        "end":15.338787,\
        "confidence":0.9721591,\
        "speaker":0,\
        "speaker_confidence":0.5853265\
      },\
    ...\
    ]\
  }\
]
```

### Live Streaming

When using diarization for live streaming audio, only the `speaker` value will be returned:

JSON

```
...
"alternatives":[\
  {\
    ...\
    "words": [\
      {\
        "word":"hello",\
        "start":15.259043,\
        "end":15.338787,\
        "confidence":0.9721591,\
        "speaker":0\
      },\
    ...\
    ]\
  }\
]
```

## Format Response

To improve readability, you can use a JSON processor to parse the JSON. In this example, we use [JQ](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/) and further improve readability by turning on Deepgram’s [punctuation](https://developers.deepgram.com/docs/punctuation) and [utterances](https://developers.deepgram.com/docs/utterances) features:

cURL

```
curl \
  --request POST \
  --url 'https://api.deepgram.com/v1/listen?diarize_model=latest&punctuate=true&utterances=true' \
  --header 'Authorization: Token YOUR_DEEPGRAM_API_KEY' \
  --header 'content-type: audio/mp3' \
  --data-binary @Premier_broken-phone_numbers.mp3 | jq -r ".results.utterances[] | \"[Speaker:\(.speaker)] \(.transcript)\""
```

Replace `YOUR_DEEPGRAM_API_KEY` with your [Deepgram API Key](https://console.deepgram.com/signup?jump=keys).

When the file is finished processing, you’ll receive the following response:

```
[Speaker:0] Hello, and thank you for calling premier phone service. Please be aware that this call may be recorded for quality and training purposes.
[Speaker:0] My name is Beth, and I will be assisting you today. How are you doing?
[Speaker:1] Not too bad. How are you today?
[Speaker:0] I'm doing well. Thank you. May I please have your name?
[Speaker:1] My name is Blake...
```
